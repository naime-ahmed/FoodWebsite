            <h2 class="benifit">Maintain Nutrition</h2>
            <p class="Details">When a restaurant says that they serve the most nutritious food, donâ€™t believe it. They are there for business and will only do what can add to their profits. So they will have to compromise the nutrition value of their dishes to adjust their profit margins. One of the benefits of home cooked food is that you have control over the nutritional value of the food you eat. Depending on the recipe that you are using, you can buy the healthier and nutritious ingredients to meet your needs. With that, you will avoid eating bad food in some restaurants.</p>
